There are several types of button, each with specific states:

 - *Primary* that highlight the main call to action on the page. 
This is the only button form the customer sees on the main page body
This button is also used in the drawer

 - *Secondary* (ghost) that highlight the second most-popular option in a drawer
Secondary buttons should be used for the less favoured option e.g. remove, continue without adding etc., and should ALWAYS be used in conjunction with a preferred option that uses the primary button
It should be an extreme edge case that the secondary button is in a disabled state
